### Directory Layout

Before you start, take a moment to see how the project structure looks like:

```sh
.
├── /src/                       # The source code of the application
|   | # Typescript
│   ├── /models/                # Data models
│   ├── /actions/               # The actions to external APIs
│   ├── /stores/                # The stores that handle declarative state of the APIs actions.
|   | # UI Components
|   ├── /components/            # Reusable basic components of the UI that are isolated (e.g. buttons)
|   ├── /layouts/               # Reusable layouts of the UI
|   ├── /cards/                 # Reusable components of the UI that can use stores
|   ├── /pages/                 # Pages of the application
├── /dist/                      # The folder for compiled output
├── /node_modules/              # The dependencies
├── .gitignore                  # List of files that should be ignored by git
├── ARCHITECTURE.md             # ARCHITECTURE file

├── tsconfig.json
```

**NOTE**: Source code is ordered by dependency tree (each directory can only use upper ones)
